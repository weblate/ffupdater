FFUpdater will check periodically for updates and will display a notification when an update is available. This feature itself can be disabled and the check frequency can be changed.

FFUpdater will also automatically download the app updates in the background if the current network is unmetered and the device has enough storage.

Please reopen FFUpdater after moving it to the internal/external storage.
