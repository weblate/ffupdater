and:

FFUpdater will check periodically for updates and will display a notification when an update is available. This feature
itself can be disabled and the check frequency can be changed.

FFUpdater will also automatically download the app updates in the background if the current network is unmetered and the
device has enough storage.

## Security measures

- The certificate fingerprint of every downloaded APK file is checked and validated against an internal allowlist. This
  prevents the installation of malicious app versions that do not originate from the original developer. The certificate
  fingerprints will be displayed in the app and be check by yourself. Some websites like apkmirror.com list these
  fingerprints for every app.
- No unencrypted traffic is used or accepted, which can potentially be modified by attackers. Only HTTPS connections.
- Slight risk for a machine-in-the-middle-attack: FFUpdater trusts HTTPS certificates which are installed by the user (
  called "user certificates"). This is necessary for AdGuard (see
  [GitHub-Issue](https://github.com/Tobi823/ffupdater/issues/37)). Be careful which certificates you install. A
  malicious certificate can prevent FFUpdater finding new updates.

Feel free to check my source code ;)

## Other distribution channels

The main distribution method of FFUpdater remains F-Droid - this will not change. But you can use the APK files or the
F-Droid repository to quickly install fixed versions.

You need to uninstall FFUpdater every time you switch between F-Droid version and my version.

I don't know if F-Droid shows an update notification when you have my version installed. Maybe you need to manually
check for updates in the F-Droid app.

My versions will be signed with:

```
DN: CN=Tobi823, O=FFUpdater, ST=Germany, C=DE
SHA-256 digest: f4e642bb85cbbcfd7302b2cbcbd346993a41067c27d995df492c9d0d38747e62
SHA-1 digest: b432e9eb74512c0fa58c1ec45912a670f8dfa8e9
MD5 digest: 78a34e36cedd844954726f1e2076642c
```

The official F-Droid Android client sometimes has problems accessing the APK file from my F-Droid repository. But other
clients like "Foxy Droid" work fine. Does anyone know the reason for this? Does the official F-Droid client has an
internal cache and therefore needs more time before it can access a new version from my repository?

### APK files on GitHub

The APK files are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tobi823/ffupdater/releases) and
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Tobiwan/ffupdater_gitlab/-/tags).

[How to Add a Repo to F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/tutorials/add-repo/)

It seems that this F-Droid repository is sometimes a little buggy. If F-Droid fails to download FFUpdater, try to
install the version from the official F-Droid repository first.

On the app page under the item "Versions" you can see from which repository (my *FFUpdater*
repository or the official *F-Droid* repository) the app version was installed

## FAQ

- By clicking on the "i"-Icon, you can see the time of the last successful background update check.
- Firefox Nightly: Replace the minutes with 'xx' because FFUpdater can only access the start time of the build and not
  the version name of the app update (finish time). The builds always starts at 5:00 and 17:00 and usually takes a few
  minutes.
- I don't optimize the APK file with minifyEnabled and shrinkResources because it makes the app harder to debug
- Tor Browser / Orbot: I will not support them because they can be installed with F-Droid.
  (Go to Settings > Repositories > Enable "Guardian Project Official Releases".)
  I don't feel confident enough that I can install and update the Tor Browser / Orbot securely
  (because I think there is much more at stake than with other browsers).
- Please reopen FFUpdater after moving it to the internal/external storage.

## Deprecated browsers#

### Styx Browser

02.01.2022 https://github.com/Tobi823/ffupdater/issues/101

Styx is only temporarily removed from Google Play:

> Sorry for the premature end of Styx. But in the future the Styx browser will appear again. Currently styx
> is migrated to Fulguris base. When this is completed then Styx will return as well as in the Play Store.

30.12.2021: https://github.com/Tobi823/ffupdater/issues/101

It seems that @jamal2362 does not maintain the Styx browser any longer:

- The GitHub repository (https://github.com/jamal2362/Styx) is deleted or private.
- Styx is removed from Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamal2367.styx).

Due to the deleted GitHub repository, Styx cannot be downloaded by FFUpdater. And even if - end users should not use a
browser that is no longer updated.

### Kiwi Browser

17.04.2021: https://github.com/Tobi823/ffupdater/issues/35
Answer from the Kiwi developer:

> It's actually quite simple, Kiwi earns money for every search it forwards to Yahoo or Microsoft Bing.

It seems that the developers have to forward search requests to their servers and then to the search engine in order to
get paid by the search engine.

> The parameters and integration method are defined by the search engines themselves, we don't have our words
> at all how the integration is done.

> They [Yahoo or Microsoft Bing] have a standard guide on how to integrate, either you follow this guide, or
> you don't work with them.

I guess it's fine. Although i don't like it, i understand that the money for the app development has to come from
somewhere (even Firefox is paid to use "Google" as the default search engine).

But I think that Kiwi should not be managed by FFUpdater because this browser has additional usability features and no
additional privacy features. FFUpdater is about privacy and not usability.

### Firefox Lite

02.12.2021: End of support for Firefox Lockwise https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-of-support-firefox-lockwise
> Mozilla will end support for the Firefox Lockwise app on Android and iOS, effective December 13, 2021.

14.03.2021: The latest release of Firefox Lite is not longer signed and thereby can't be used to upgrade an existing
Firefox Lite installation. Moreover the developers haven't responded to the Github issue "[BUG]
Unsigned apk ?" from 30.01.2021
https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/FirefoxLite/issues/5353. And Firefox Lite will only receive bug fixes in the future:
> Firefox Lite is currently in Maintenance Mode. No active feature is being done on the product.
> Older Pull Requests and Issues have been marked with the archived label and have been closed.
> However, if you feel an issue is critical enough to be re-opened, please leave a note on the issue
> with an explanation.

30.06.2021: Firefox Lite is removed from Google Play and Galaxy Store, its repository is
archived (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/FirefoxLite) and development stopped.

> Effective June 30, 2021, this app will no longer receive security or other updates. Download the official
> Firefox Android app now for a fast, private & safe web browser.

These are the reasons why I will remove Firefox Lite.

### Fennec

16.05.2020: Mozilla wants to migrate from Fennec to Fenix. Fennec Beta and Fennec Nightly are already end-of-life and
Fennec Release will be soon.

27.07.2020: 68.11.0 is the last released update for Fennec version, all Fennec browsers are deprecated.

> Fennec is being replaced by our new state-of-the-art mobile browser codenamed "Fenix". We're slowly
> migrating users in order to make sure the experience is as painless and as enjoyable as possible. We
> started to migrate users who were using Fennec Nightly in January (bug 1608882). It took us several weeks
> to be sure of the result and to finally offer Fenix Nightly to all users using Fennec Nightly. Another
> few weeks later, we repeated the same process with Fennec Beta (bug 1614287). Fenix Beta has been offered
> to the whole Fennec Beta population on April 22nd. We're planning to do the same with Fennec Release
> sometimes this year. The schedule is still to be determined.

> The Google Play Store[1] has a lot of nice features, but it's still pretty basic whenever a software
> publisher wants to slowly migrate users. Once a migration is started, we can't provide any Fennec updates
> to the population who wasn't offered Fenix, yet. I can say this restriction is painful to manage for
> Android developers, Mozilla included. Because of it, we had to stop shipping Fennec Nightly/Beta APKs at
> the beginning of each migration. This explains the dates of the last builds. At the same time, we stopped
> building Fennec Nightly/Beta because it enabled us to save technical resources[2] as well as people's
> time[3].

## Build app

Use Android Studio to clone and run the app. Nothing special needs to be done.

## Maintainer:

### Tobiwan (now)

### Boris Kraut (https://gitlab.com/krt/ffupdater, until April 2019)

> Since I left F-Droid (and Android/Smartphones) about a year ago, I am looking for a new maintainer to take
> over. Unfortunately the upstream issue I opened years ago is still not solved in 2019. While Fennec F-Droid
> is back in the mainline repo and other binary repos do serve Firefox, some might still prefer this updater.
> So as I said: Maintainers welcome. The main task should be to test the last few merge requests (especially
> the background update stuff) and release a new version.
